A term project of a full-stack web-based application

This project demonstrates an automobile company website with showing available cars. It consists of 5 pages which are "home" page, two product pages ("sedan" and "suv"), "about us" page and "contact us" page.

There is an admin page for internal staff to add/edit/delete car(s). When an admin performs the actions, the corresponding data will be processed via express nodeJS in MongoDB Atlas.

We also use Google map API in the "contact us" page for demonstrating using external API service. The API link may not be valid as time goes by.
